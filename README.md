>**Pal wakes up to a disaster!**
With no crew left after the storm, it's up to Pal to survive and make it to land.

I believe this is the first project I've done that we actually ran out of time to make a working game. 
We're actually on good pace throughout the whole time, but there were challenges in the way that took us longer than expected. However, we're going to continue it afterwards and make it the best as it can be! - fiaKaiera

Surprisingly, this is the first time I sort of stalled working on a game jam.
Normally we'd blast this down with no sweat, but in return, we learned some new things definitely and got comfier with what I'm working with. I'm quite excited to return to this but hey, at least we finished with all mechanics there! - Wishdream
